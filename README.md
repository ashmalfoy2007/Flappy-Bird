# Flappy-Bird
Hi! I'm anushka, this is my first project, based on python. Its based on the flappy bird, a classic game. It recreates the addictive, side-scrolling mobile game where the player controls a bird attempting to fly between a continuous series of pipes without hitting them or the ground.
A simple, fun, and classic Flappy Bird clone built using Python and Pygame.
This project recreates the iconic gameplay where you guide a tiny bird through endless pipes by tapping to keep it in the air.
